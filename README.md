Digital Hardware Design and Modelling
=====================================
## Using Verilog, SystemVerilog, VHDL, SystemC, HLS (C++, OpenCL)

Idea of this repo came from my own answer(advice) I wrote for a question on quora: [VLSI: What are good ways to learn to get better at digital design?](https://www.quora.com/VLSI-What-are-good-ways-to-learn-to-get-better-at-digital-design/answer/Varun-Nagpal-3?srid=tSKg "VLSI: What are good ways to learn to get better at digital design?"). This repository serves as a means to accomplish some of the ways I had discussed in my answer.

The idea for this repository is to therefore build hardware models in Verilog, SystemVerilog, VHDL,  SystemC, HLS(C++,OpenCL) at various levels of abstraction: Logic, RTL,TLM and Behavioral/Algorithmic. Also, as much as possible, focus would be to make the hardware models which are:
- Generic, Reusable and Portable
- Built using best practices for design and coding
- Integrable in larger designs through simple handshake interface or as Memory mapped Master/Slave IP on industry standard bus interfaces such as AXI
- Script driven
  - C simulation (golden reference stimulus-response generation)
  - C/RTL Co-simulation (Pre-Synthesis or RTL Functional Verification using Testbenches )
  - IP Export and IP Integration (Memory mapped master/slave)
  - Design constraint specification (clock, i/o pin constraints)
  - Logic Synthesis
  - Post-Synthesis or Gate Level Functional Verification using Testbenches
  - Technology Mapping
  - Placement and Routing
  - Timing Analysis and Closure
  - Reporting (waveform dumps, timing, area, power)
  - Bit-stream generation and writing bitstream on target FPGA device
  - In-circuit testing of design on target FPGA board through JTAG/GPIO ports using signal generators, integrated/external logic analyzers setup as a test-fixture.
